This is a ticker, mostly for streaming on mcmooks

Click on one of the .jar files, enter in a long enough string (it has to be longer than the window)
and you are good to go!

The string is seperated on each "---" string and given a random color.


Development: It is built on libgdx and as such you will have to go through a great deal of pain
to get it working
